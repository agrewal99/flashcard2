  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the significance of bulbous roots?", answer: "Bulbous roots indicate hypercementosis and can complicate extractions due to their irregular shape." },
    { question: "What conditions may cause swelling in the submandibular gland?", answer: "Salivary gland stones, infections, autoimmune diseases, or tumors may cause swelling." },
    { question: "How can fibrous dysplasia affect the jaw?", answer: "It leads to structural deformities, asymmetry, and appears as 'ground-glass' radiopacity on radiographs." },
    { question: "What is an OAC, and how does it occur?", answer: "An OAC is an opening between the oral cavity and sinus, often after upper posterior tooth extractions." },
    { question: "What is the clinical management for maxillary sinus polyps?", answer: "Treatment includes decongestants, corticosteroids, antibiotics, or surgical removal if necessary." },
    { question: "What are common causes of periapical lesions?", answer: "Caused by pulp infections; treated with root canal therapy or apicoectomy for persistent cases." },
    { question: "What precautions should be taken after a sinus lift?", answer: "Avoid sneezing, nose blowing, and using straws; take prescribed antibiotics and decongestants." },
    { question: "What are the radiographic signs of osteoradionecrosis?", answer: "Irregular bone destruction with radiolucent and radiopaque areas; clinically seen as exposed non-healing bone." },
    { question: "What is the importance of scaling history in periodontal evaluation?", answer: "It helps assess past treatment effectiveness and guides future interventions like root planing or surgery." },
    { question: "What is the management protocol for salivary gland stones?", answer: "Promote hydration, use sialogogues, or remove surgically if necessary; persistent cases may require gland excision." },
    { question: "How is a periapical cyst differentiated from a granuloma?", answer: "A cyst is epithelial-lined, appearing radiographically as a defined radiolucency; a granuloma lacks epithelial lining." },
    { question: "What are signs of chronic maxillary sinusitis on radiographs?", answer: "Signs include mucosal thickening, air-fluid levels, or sinus opacification, often accompanied by facial pain." },
    { question: "How can dental infections cause Ludwig's angina?", answer: "Dental infections may spread to fascial neck spaces, causing life-threatening airway obstruction. Immediate IV antibiotics and drainage are needed." },
    { question: "What is the pathophysiology of hypercementosis?", answer: "Hypercementosis involves excessive cementum deposition, often linked to trauma or systemic diseases like Paget's." },
    { question: "What are the risks of an unerupted molar near the inferior dental canal?", answer: "It may damage the nerve during extraction, causing paresthesia. CBCT imaging helps assess proximity." }
